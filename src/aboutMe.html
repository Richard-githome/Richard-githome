<h2>☀︎ Things to know about me ☀︎</h2>

<p>
    I graduated from University of Nigeria, Nsukka with Bachelor's Degree in Economics in June, 2021, and completed my National Youth Service in February, 2023. <br>
    The desire to solve time and context-specific business/product challenges alongside that of the society drifted my interest from data analytics into software engineering.
    <br>
    Prior, I have gained realtime experiences in onsite workspaces, customer relation and retention services, project management, and leadership.
